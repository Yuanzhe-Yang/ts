## Setting

### Module
**package.json**
    **dependencies & devDependencies**: Look at these sections to see which libraries and frameworks the project uses (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, Jest, etc.). This tells you about the tech stack.
    **scripts**: Check the scripts to understand how to run, build, and test the project. Common scripts include dev, build, test, and lint.


**src/**: Once you understand the tech stack, dive into the source code. This is where the application's logic, components, and features are implemented. Look for an entry file like main.ts, index.ts, or App.tsx to start tracing how the application works.
    

**tsconfig.json**: Read this file to understand how TypeScript is configured. The compilerOptions will tell you about the JavaScript version it compiles to (target), how it resolves modules (moduleResolution), and how strict the type checking is (strict). This is crucial for understanding the codebase's quality standards.
    

**pnpm-workspace.yaml**: Since this file exists, it's critical to understand the project is a monorepo. Open it to see the structure and how the different internal packages or applications are organized. This will give you a high-level view of the entire system's architecture.
